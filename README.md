# Simulate and Recover Background & Description
#### The results from my simulation_results.txt file show that the EZ diffusion model is most efficient at higher sample sizes and leads to skewed estimates when N decreases. With N = 10, the estimates are noticeably inaccurate. Drift rate (v), which measures how quickly information is gathered, is underestimated with a bias of -0.48 and a squared error of 1.55, meaning the model isn’t capturing how fast decisions are actually being made. Boundary separation (a), which reflects decisioan caution, is even further off, underestimated by -1.14 with a squared error of 6.34. This suggests that with very little data, the model incorrectly assumes that people are taking significantly bigger risks than they actually are. Nondecision time (t), which accounts for processes like perceiving a stimulus and pressing a button, is slightly overestimated with a bias of 0.13. However, its squared error (0.11) is lower than the other two parameters which means that while its estimates are still off, they are somewhat more stable.

#### When the sample size increases to N = 40, we see a clear improvement. The bias for drift rate drops to -0.05, with a squared error of 0.17, meaning the model’s estimates are getting much closer to the actual values. Boundary separation is still slightly underestimated (-0.14 bias, 0.73 squared error), but it is no longer as drastically off as before. Nondecision time also improves, with a bias of 0.02 and a squared error of just 0.016, showing that as the dataset grows, the model becomes better at estimating parameters.

#### Finally, at N = 4000, the estimates are nearly perfect. Bias is basically zero (0.001 for v, 0.0005 for a, and -0.0004 for t), and the squared errors are incredibly small (0.001, 0.00015, and 0.00004, respectively). With enough data, the EZ diffusion model can recover the original parameter values with little error. The high squared errors at lower sample sizes mean that random fluctuations have a bigger impact when there aren’t enough observations to balance them out. If you only have a few data points, an outlier like one unusually fast or slow response, can skew the results.

#### Overall, these results show the trade-off of using the EZ diffusion model: it is a fast and easy way to estimate decision-making parameters, but small sample sizes can make it prone to some errors. This is especially important when estimating boundary separation, which appears to be the most sensitive to data limitations. There is risk of drawing misleading conclusions about how cautious or impulsive participants actually are if there is not a big enough sample size. This goes for interpreting data in general that more data leads to better estimates, so the EZ diffusion model is a useful tool but it's also important to recognize it's not perfect.
