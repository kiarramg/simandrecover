# Simulate and Recover Background & Description
## 1. Explain theoretical background of EZ diffusion.
### The EZ diffusion model is a simplified approach to the drift diffusion model (DDM), which is commonly used in cognitive science to analyze decision-making processes based on response times (RTs) and accuracy. The model is considered effective if it can successfully recover key parameters — drift rate (v), boundary separation (a), and nondecision time (t) - when applied to data that was originally generated using the same model. This is necessary in order to ensure that the model functions as expected before it is applied to experimental data.
### The process begins with selecting a set of “true” parameters and a sample size (N). Using these parameters, the forward equations of the EZ diffusion model generate predicted summary statistics, which include the accuracy rate (R_pred), mean RT (M_pred), and RT variance (V_pred). However, real-world data is noisy and the observed data will not always perfectly match theoretical predictions. To account for this, observed summary statistics (R_obs, M_obs, V_obs) are simulated using known probability distributions. These steps introduce realistic variability, mimicking the way actual experimental data may fluctuate.
### Once the observed summary statistics are generated, the inverse equations of the EZ diffusion model are applied to estimate the original parameters. The estimated values ( v_est, a_est, t_est) are then compared to the true values to assess the model’s accuracy. This is done by computing the estimation bias (b), which represents the difference between the true and estimated parameters, and the squared error (b^2), which measures the overall deviation. Ideally, the bias should be close to zero on average, and the squared error should decrease as the sample size increases. If these conditions are met, it suggests that the model can reliably recover its own parameters under controlled conditions.

## 2. Summarize results (plots of bias/squared error vs. N).
### Based on these results, increasing the sample size improves the reliability of the parameter estimates, thus reducing variability and error. The findings demonstrate a clear relationship between sample size and estimation accuracy. When N = 10, the estimates are highly biased, specifically for boundary separation (α), which is underestimated by approximately -1.13. The drift rate (ν) and nondecision time (τ) also show deviations from their true values but to a lesser extent. The squared errors are relatively large, suggesting that the parameter estimates are not reliable when the sample size is small. 
### As the sample size increases to N = 40, the bias in parameter estimates decreases substantially. The estimates for drift rate (ν) and nondecision time (τ) become much more accurate, with biases close to zero. However, boundary separation (α) still exhibits some degree of underestimation. The squared errors also decrease significantly, indicating that the model is performing better at recovering the true parameters.  
### At N = 4000, the estimates have significantly improved and are the best out of the 3. The values for bias are approaching zero across all three parameters. The squared errors are also extremely small, confirming that the model is highly accurate when given a large enough dataset. This result aligns with statistical expectations: as sample size increases, the observed summary statistics converge toward their true values, allowing the EZ diffusion model to recover the underlying parameters with minimal error. These findings provide strong evidence that the EZ diffusion model is a reliable tool for parameter estimation, but only under conditions where the sample size is sufficiently large.

## 3. Discuss interpretation (i.e., whether EZ diffusion is consistent).
### Overall, the results demonstrate that larger sample sizes lead to more accurate parameter recovery, while smaller sample sizes introduce significant estimation errors. While the model is computationally efficient and provides a straightforward way to estimate cognitive parameters from response time data, its accuracy is highly dependent on sample size. This simulation confirms that if the data truly follow an EZ diffusion process, the model can recover them accurately, but researchers must be cautious when working with small datasets, as high estimation errors in such cases can lead to misleading conclusions.
